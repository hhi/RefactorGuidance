# RefactorGuidance
Within this project the possibilities are explored of generating adaptive instructions on refactoring procedures within a Java project.

Instructions are adapted based on the code structure context of a given piece of java code. 

The instructions are based on the advices as described in 'Refactoring: Improving the design of existing code'
The focus  is to help, especially novice software students, understanding the process of some specific refactorings and make them aware where possible risky structures are present in code when preforming the refactoring. It should provide information that might help them in better understanding and making better decissions when performing refactorings manualy or automatically.
